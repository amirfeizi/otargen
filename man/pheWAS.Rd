\title{Retrieve PheWAS (Phenome Wide Association Studies) data for a variant.}
\usage{
pheWAS(variant_id)
}
\arguments{
\item{variant_id}{Character: generated ID for variants by Open Targets (e.g. 1_154119580_C_A) or rsId (rs2494663).}
}
\value{
A data frame with PheWAS associations.

The output data frame contains the following columns:
\itemize{
  \item{\code{totalGWASStudies}:} An integer indicating the total number of GWAS studies where the variant is associated.
  \item{\code{pval}:} A numeric value representing the p-value of the association between the variant and the trait.
  \item{\code{beta}:} A numeric value representing the beta value, which represents the effect size of the variant on the trait.
  \item{\code{oddsRatio}:} A numeric value representing the odds ratio, measuring the association between the variant and the trait.
  \item{\code{nTotal}:} An integer indicating the total number of participants in the study.
  \item{\code{study.studyId}:} A character vector representing the study ID.
  \item{\code{study.source}:} A character vector representing the source of the study.
  \item{\code{study.pmid}:} A character vector representing the PubMed ID (PMID) of the study.
  \item{\code{study.pubDate}:} A character vector representing the publication date of the study.
  \item{\code{study.traitReported}:} A character vector representing the reported trait associated with the variant.
  \item{\code{study.traitCategory}:} A character vector representing the category of the trait.

\description{
PheWAS (\emph{Phenome-wide association study}) is a method that investigates the relationships
between genetic variants and traits or phenotypes, helping in the study of their
potential influence on multiple traits or diseases concurrently. This function retrieves
the traits associated with a given variant in the \emph{UK Biobank}, \emph{FinnGen},
and/or \emph{GWAS Catalog} summary statistics repository (only traits with a p-value
less than 0.005 are returned).
