\title{Retrieve top studies having overlap in identified loci.}
\usage{
topOverlappedStudies(study_id, pageindex = 0, pagesize = 20)
}
\arguments{
\item{study_id}{Character: Open Targets generated ID for a GWAS study.}

\item{pageindex}{Integer: Index of the current page for pagination (>= 0).}

\item{pagesize}{Integer: Number of records in a page for pagination (> 0).}
}
\value{
Returns a data frame with the top studies containing the following columns:
\itemize{
  \item{\code{study.studyId}:} \emph{Character}. Study ID of the input study.
  \item{\code{study.traitReported}:} \emph{Character}. Reported trait of the input study.
  \item{\code{study.traitCategory}:} \emph{Character}. Category of the trait in the input study.
  \item{\code{topStudiesByLociOverlap.studyId}:} \emph{Character}. Study ID of the top associated studies.
  \item{\code{topStudiesByLociOverlap.study.studyId}:} \emph{Character}. Study ID of the top associated studies.
  \item{\code{topStudiesByLociOverlap.study.traitReported}:} \emph{Character}. Reported trait of the top associated studies.
  \item{\code{topStudiesByLociOverlap.study.traitCategory}:} \emph{Character}. Category of the trait in the top associated studies.
  \item{\code{topStudiesByLociOverlap.numOverlapLoci}:} \emph{Integer}. Number of loci overlapped with the input study.

\description{
For a provided study ID, the function, retrieves top studies with overlap in their identified loci with the queried study loci.
